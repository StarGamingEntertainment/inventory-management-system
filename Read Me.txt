Added Details By 'Ricky Downey' that you have to change, To Get Everything Working Correctly!!!!
  1. Goto: inventory-management-system-master/database directory
    1.1 Open the constants.php file and change the line below 1.2, to your url of your website, or look at example below for XAMPP 1.3
    1.2 Change: define("DOMAIN","http://localhost/inv_project/public_html");
    1.3 To XAMPP example: define("DOMAIN","http://localhost/inventory-management-system-master");
        This means that the main inventory-management-system-master folder is in the htdocs folder, of the XAMPP Folder.
  2. Goto: inventory-management-system-master/database directory again
    2.1 uncomment these two lines (get rid of the forward slashes //)
        $db = new Database();
        $db->connect();
  3. Goto: inventory-management-system-master/js directory
    3.1 Open all 3 files, main.js, manage.js and order.js
    3.2 Change this line at the top of each file: var DOMAIN = "http://localhost/inv_project/public_html";
    3.3 to the same as what you put in deatils 1. above

Now you are ready to run index file. in your browser url top bar type example: http://locahost/inventory-management-system-master
that is it.
Good luck
